# VSTManager-Flask
An experimental [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web app version of VST Manager.

The C# version of VSTManager is best supported on Windows, but VST instruments are used on three platforms. VSTManager-Flask is an experiment to build a rudimentary cross-platform version of VSTManager. Python is supported on all the platforms, but has no standard GUI library, so I used web technologies to make the GUI. The client and server both run locally on the user's computer to create a visual interface for the program. VSTManager-Flask is compatible with the original VSTManager and vice versa.
